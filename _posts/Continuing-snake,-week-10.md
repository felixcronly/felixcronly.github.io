  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Even when just typing got boring we carried on hoping that the game would come into place, and be less broken, as it was already quite broken.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We asked ourselves, near the end of the lesson, if there were any mistakes we had made, that we needed to fix. We then found the mistakes and fixed them, so all worked well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked on our own until we needed help</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We looked back on the code we had already done, to find out why the snake wasn't moving properly</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When we were working on it, though, we were working very hard.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We should have been more careful with what we did, as we didnâ€™t understand what we were actually typing, and we had made a big mistake earlier.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We will try to understand the code we are typing rather than just typing randomly what it says on the screen.</td>
