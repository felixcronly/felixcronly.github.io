    <td>When Mr. Keen said it didnâ€™t work he said we should do one of the Minecraft lessons, but it wasn't on that specific fuze box. We then spent quite a bit of time recycling through the different fuze boxes to find if any of them had it on, and probably spent a bit more time then needed on it.</td>
