    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We asked ourselves, what is the fuze box missing to be able to work, when we realised it had no way to connect to the monitor we finally figured it out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We didn't ask for help when we didn’t understand, instead tried to carry on working on the task.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Looking back we could have been more efficient in time, as we didn’t use everything he gave us, which we should have as it would have helped.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We were trying to work really hard on understanding how and why thin fuze worked as it did, and what we could do to make it work.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At first, we didn’t actually use the booklet that he gave us, which would have helped a lot as it gave us the answers to the questions we were asking ourselves, so if we had used it it would have been a lot more of a productive lesson.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>If we had been more willing to accept that we were wrong, and not that we were right every time, it might have been a lot better, as then we should have been able to work harder and faster.</td>
