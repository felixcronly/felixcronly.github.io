    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We carried on trying with the LEDs until we knew we needed help</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>We asked ourselves where the bulbs went in the bread board, and how we were meant to work that out for ourselves from the code and the numbers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We tried, at first, to work on our own on snake, we only asked for help when we really knew that we couldn't work out what had gone wong, and why it was wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We tried to work reall hard on snake, who we could get as much done as we could.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We could have realised why our thing went wrong earlier, instead of just asking for help, as we probably could have worked it out if we hadn't asked for help so early, and instead tried a bit harder.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson we will try a bit harder to be a bit more independent when it comes to problems, as we could have worked them out more easily if we had tried.</td>
